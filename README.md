Lectures notes, videos and R code will be made available through the workshop’s website.

Workshop objectives

In the theoretical section attendees will learn basic quantitative genetics concepts and basic statistical methods for genetic data analysis with a focus on genomic selection.

Workshop Format

Nine lectures (20- 30 minutes each) will be prerecorded and videos will be available through the website. Three live discussion sessions each one hour will be held each one covering three of the pre-recorded lectures.
